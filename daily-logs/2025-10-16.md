## Goals
- Unblock end-to-end ingestion for photos: batch upload → DB → derived/thumbnail generation → basic API responses.
- Add privacy/encryption flag and enforce basic viewing restrictions.

## Completed
- **Backend**
  - Batch upload API wiring: `backend/routes/photos.js`, `backend/controllers/photoController.js`.
  - Added/propagated privacy flag (e.g. `effective_private`) used by frontend to restrict detail viewing.
  - Derived images/thumbnail pipeline: `backend/scripts/ensure-thumbnails.js`.
  - API response normalization and compatibility handling in controllers (returned shape `{ success, data, pagination }` when possible).
- **Frontend**
  - Photos page fetch/render skeleton: `frontend/src/pages/Photos/index.jsx` (basic listing and pagination hooks; no masonry yet).
  - Permission gating on encrypted photos (hide preview/disable click when not authorized).

## Not Done / Deferred
- No lazy-loading integration on this day.
- No preview polish yet (standard/immersive, EXIF layout, animations).
- No masonry layout—only basic rendering.

## Risks / Notes
- Orientation (EXIF) not normalized on upload; preview may look rotated until backend normalization is added.

## Next Steps
- Implement preview UX (contain, center, EXIF safe area, rotation animation).
- Add waterfall/masonry layout and plan for responsive breakpoints.
